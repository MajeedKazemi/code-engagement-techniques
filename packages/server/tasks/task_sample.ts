`This code defines a function called \`merge_intervals\` that takes a list of intervals as input and returns a list of merged intervals. 

First, it sorts the intervals in ascending order based on the first element of each interval using the \`sorted\` function. The \`lambda\` keyword is used to create a small anonymous function to specify the sorting key.

Then, it initializes the \`merged\` list with the first interval. 

Next, it iterates over the sorted intervals. For each interval, it compares the start of the current interval with the end of the last merged interval. If they overlap (i.e., the start of the current interval is less than or equal to the end of the last merged interval), it merges them by updating the end of the last merged interval to be the maximum of the ends of the current and last merged intervals. If they don't overlap, it adds the current interval to the \`merged\` list.

Finally, it returns the \`merged\` list.

The \`print\` function is used to display the result of the \`merge_intervals\` function when it is called with the list \`[(1, 3), (2, 6), (8, 10), (15, 18)]\` as an argument.`,
