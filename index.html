            <h2>Abstract</h2>
            <p>
                Novice programmers are increasingly relying on Large Language
                Models (LLMs) to generate code for learning programming
                concepts. However, this interaction can lead to superficial
                engagement, giving learners an illusion of learning and
                hindering skill development. To address this issue, we conducted
                a systematic design exploration to develop seven cognitive
                engagement techniques aimed at promoting deeper engagement with
                AI-generated code. In this paper, we describe our design
                process, the initial seven techniques, and results from a
                between-subjects study (N=82). We then iteratively refined the
                top techniques and further evaluated them through a
                within-subjects study (N=42). We evaluate the friction each
                technique introduces, their effectiveness in helping learners
                apply concepts to isomorphic tasks without AI assistance, and
                their success in aligning learners' perceived and actual coding
                abilities. Ultimately, our results highlight the most effective
                technique: guiding learners through the step-by-step
                problem-solving process, where they engage in an interactive
                dialog with the AI, prompting what needs to be done at each
                stage before the corresponding code is revealed.
